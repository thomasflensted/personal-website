My name is Thomas. I am a motion designer and filmmaker turned developer. Here are some of the projects I've made. I used to work in communications, mostly doing motion design and shooting and editing films. Here's some of my previous work. On the side, I've made a few YouTube videos about things I find interesting. In 2023, my girlfriend and I spent 10 months driving from Denmark to Mongolia and back. Sometimes, I post longer photo series from my travels. If you want to work with me or just say hi, get in touch on one of the links below.
